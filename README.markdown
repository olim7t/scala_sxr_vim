A Vim plugin providing type annotations (`F2`) and jump to declaration (`Ctrl + ]`) in Scala sources (watch [this screencast](http://olim7t.github.com/scala_sxr.vim/screencast_simple.htm) to see the features in action on a simple project).

Relies on data files generated by Mark Harrah's [sxr](http://github.com/harrah/browse) compiler plugin. Many thanks to Mark for accepting (and improving) my suggestions to make sxr multi-format.

See [INSTALL.markdown](http://github.com/olim7t/scala_sxr_vim/blob/master/INSTALL.markdown) for installation instructions.
