A Vim plugin providing type annotations (`F2`) and jump to declaration (`Ctrl + ]`) in Scala sources.

Relies on data files generated by Mark Harrah's sxr compiler plugin (http://github.com/harrah/browse). Many thanks to Mark for accepting (and improving) my suggestions to make sxr multi-format.

Installation instructions are here: http://github.com/olim7t/scala_sxr_vim/blob/master/INSTALL.markdown.
