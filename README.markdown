A Vim plugin providing type annotations (`F2`) and jump to declaration (`Ctrl + ]`) in Scala sources.

Relies on data files generated by Mark Harrah's [sxr](http://github.com/harrah/browse) compiler plugin. Many thanks to Mark for accepting (and improving) my suggestions to make sxr multi-format.

See [INSTALL.markdown](http://github.com/olim7t/scala_sxr_vim/blob/master/INSTALL.markdown) for installation instructions.
