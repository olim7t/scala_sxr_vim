A Vim plugin providing type annotations (shortcut: F2) and jump to declaration (shortcut: "Ctrl + ]") in Scala sources.

Relies on data files generated by Mark Harrah's SXR compiler plugin (http://github.com/harrah/browse). Many thanks to Mark for accepting (and improving) my suggestions to make SXR multi-format.

Quick how-to (better documentation coming soon):
* plug SXR to your project with output format "vim"
* copy scala_sxr.vim in your ftplugin directory

Todo list:
* work with continuous compilation
* make the tags human-readable
* investigate linking to other source directories
