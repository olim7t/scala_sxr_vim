A Vim plugin providing type annotations (shortcut: F2) and jump to declaration (shortcut: "Ctrl + ]") in Scala sources.

Relies on data files generated by Mark Harrah's sxr compiler plugin (http://github.com/harrah/browse). Many thanks to Mark for accepting (and improving) my suggestions to make sxr multi-format.

Quick how-to (better documentation coming soon):
* plug sxr to your project with output format "vim"
* copy scala_sxr.vim in your ftplugin directory

Todo:
* link to external sxr directories. Right now, the tag files are listed in remote-public-tags,
  but the plugin does nothing with them.
