A Vim plugin providing type annotations (shortcut: F2) and jump to declaration (shortcut: "Ctrl + ]") in Scala sources.

Relies on data files generated by Mark Harrah's sxr compiler plugin (http://github.com/harrah/browse). Many thanks to Mark for accepting (and improving) my suggestions to make sxr multi-format.

Quick how-to (better documentation coming soon):
* plug sxr to your project with output format "vim"
* copy contents of vim/ in $HOME/.vim
* add 'filetype plugin on' to your .vimrc

Todo:
* write documentation
